Is aspiring the right word? I hope it is because I'm not going to change it now, I like the way it sounds. I created this blog from scratch using React, GraphQL, and Gatsby. Prior to me working on this blog I had zero experience with GraphQL and Gatsby and had only made one React component. So it was definitely a learning experience with a lot of \"oh fuck\" moments. I'll document my process in another blog post if anyone is interested. I will say; however, that I'm looking forward to making some improvements on it and adding new features as I learn more about these and other technologies!","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":1,"column":671,"offset":670}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":1,"column":671,"offset":670}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"I started taking coding seriously when I started a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at Columbia University.
