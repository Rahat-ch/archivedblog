{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Hello world, my name is Rahat and I'm an aspiring Full Stack Web Developer. Is aspiring the right word? I hope it is because I'm not going to change it now, I like the way it sounds too much. I created this blog from scratch using React, GraphQL, and Gatsby. Prior to me working on this blog I had zero experience with GraphQL and Gatsby and had only ever made one React component. So it was definitely a learning experience with a lot of \"oh fuck\" moments. I'll document my process in another blog post if anyone is interested. I will say; however, that I'm looking forward to making some improvements on it and adding new features as I learn more about these and other technologies!</p>\n<p>I started taking my foray into coding seriously when I started a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at Columbia University. I've had my college courses and self learning prior to it but this is what really ignited the fire in me to take my skills as far as I can. With that said I'm definitely still learning my craft and thats part of why I made this blog. I want to document and blog out some of the harder things I learn in the hopes that I solidify my own knowledge and help out others starting out just like me.</p>\n<p>I'll be aiming to blog once or twice a week and maybe an extra time here and there if anything in particular excites me. My next blog will be all about higher order functions so if you want to dive right into it with me please follow me on one of my links below! It would also be lovely if you can share this post out as well. The sharing options are a bit closer down below!</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2019-01-01","title":"Hello World!","tags":["gatsbyjs","blog","code newbie","bootcamp"]}}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"/rahatcodesintro","prev":null,"next":null}}
